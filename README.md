# Disaster Recovery Network Design

This project implements a **Disaster Recovery Network** using Cisco routers (via GNS3), AWS for cloud backup, and scripting to enable automated configuration management and fault detection.

## Project Objectives

- Monitor network for link failures or misconfigurations.
- Automatically trigger backup actions (failover) when an issue is detected.
- Store and restore router configurations to/from AWS S3.
- Build a resilient and reliable network architecture suitable for disaster recovery.

## Tools & Technologies

Tools used:                                   
Cisco IOS: Router firmware and command-line configuration 
GNS3: Simulate routers and switches             
AWS S3: Cloud backup and recovery storage         
Python/Bash(optional):  Automate configuration backups
